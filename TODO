what we did here was:
ðŸš€ What We Built, Step By Step

1. User Authentication (NextAuth + MongoDB)
	â€¢	Set up NextAuth with CredentialsProvider to handle secure user login & signup.
	â€¢	Used MongoDB for user storage with hashed passwords.
	â€¢	Ensured session handling works with Next.js App Router.
	â€¢	Added server checks so only logged-in users can access protected pages (dashboard, shorten URL, etc).
	â€¢	Blocked login/signup with your own domain via .env variable.

â¸»

2. Short URL Generation
	â€¢	Built an authenticated route (/shorten) where users can submit long URLs.
	â€¢	On submission, generated a unique short code, saved it with the original URL and the userâ€™s ID in the database.
	â€¢	Returned and displayed the new short URL to the user.

â¸»

3. Redirection by Short Code
	â€¢	Created a dynamic route (/[shortCode]/page.js) that finds the original long URL from the short code and redirects the visitor.
	â€¢	Each redirect increments a click counter for analytics.

â¸»

4. User Dashboard: Link Management
	â€¢	Created a dashboard where users can:
	â€¢	See all their own short URLs, click counts, and creation dates.
	â€¢	Edit or delete their own URLs from a client component.
	â€¢	Ensured data is passed safely from server components (sanitized/serialized).

â¸»

5. Admin Dashboard
	â€¢	Added an isAdmin and banned field to the User model.
	â€¢	Created /admin dashboard accessible only to admins.
	â€¢	Admins can:
	â€¢	See/search all users and all URLs (by email or link)
	â€¢	Delete or edit any URL
	â€¢	Ban/unban users
	â€¢	Built admin tools as a protected server component, with interactive client component for search, ban, delete, etc.

â¸»

6. Sign Out Button
	â€¢	Created a reusable client-side sign out button with NextAuthâ€™s signOut.
	â€¢	Rendered only for logged-in users via a server session check in your layout or header.

â¸»

7. Security & Quality Improvements
	â€¢	Prevented duplicate signups and signups with blocked domains.
	â€¢	Made sure only logged-in users can access logged-in pages, and blocked access to /login or /signup when already logged in.
	â€¢	Used environment variables for secrets, DB credentials, and your forbidden signup domain.
	â€¢	Gave you deployment advice for Vercel (required env variables, updating domain after deploy, etc).

â¸»

8. Production Ready
	â€¢	Provided clear folder structure and separation of server/client code for Next.js App Router.
	â€¢	Advised on admin user setup and how to update admin status in MongoDB.

â¸»

9. You Now Have
	â€¢	A modern, full-stack Next.js app with login/signup, URL shortening, analytics, personal & admin dashboards, and all best-practice security checks in place.

Let me know if you want this step-by-step as a README section, onboarding doc, or want to highlight any part in more detail!






steps:
1. Project Setup
	â€¢	Create new Next.js app (npx create-next-app@latest your-app-name)
	â€¢	Install dependencies: like bcrypt taiwlind...


2. MongoDB Connection
	â€¢	Set up MongoDB cluster on Atlas (or local)
	â€¢	Whitelist your IP for access (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for dev)
	â€¢	Add your MongoDB URI to .env.local as MONGODB_URI=...

â¸»

3. User Model
	â€¢	Create models/User.js with fields: name, email, password, isAdmin, banned

â¸»

4. NextAuth Setup
	â€¢	Configure NextAuth with CredentialsProvider in lib/authOptions.js
	â€¢	Set up NextAuth API route in /app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js
	â€¢	Add secret (NEXTAUTH_SECRET) and NEXTAUTH_URL in .env.local

â¸»

5. Registration Endpoint
	â€¢	Create /app/api/register/route.js to handle user sign up:
	â€¢	Validate fields
	â€¢	Check for existing user
	â€¢	Block forbidden domains (BLOCKED_SIGNUP_DOMAIN)
	â€¢	Hash password and save user

â¸»

6. Login Page
	â€¢	Create /app/login/LoginForm.jsx as a client component for the login form
	â€¢	Create /app/login/page.jsx as a server component that:
	â€¢	Redirects logged-in users to /dashboard
	â€¢	Renders the login form for others

â¸»

7. Signup Page
	â€¢	Repeat similar structure as login for /signup

â¸»

8. Protect Routes
	â€¢	In pages like /dashboard, /shorten, /urls, use getServerSession to protect routes (redirect to /login if not authenticated)

â¸»

9. URL Model
	â€¢	Create models/Url.js with fields: longUrl, shortCode, owner, createdAt, clicks

â¸»

10. Shorten URL API
	â€¢	Create /app/api/shorten/route.js to:
	â€¢	Check session
	â€¢	Validate URL
	â€¢	Generate unique short code
	â€¢	Save URL with owner
	â€¢	Return short URL

â¸»

11. Shorten Page
	â€¢	Create /app/shorten/page.jsx (server: session check, renders form)
	â€¢	Create ShortenForm.jsx (client: handles input and POSTs to API)

â¸»

12. Redirect by ShortCode
	â€¢	Create /app/[shortCode]/page.js to:
	â€¢	Look up the long URL from the code
	â€¢	Increment clicks
	â€¢	Redirect, or show 404 if not found

â¸»

13. User Dashboard (All URLs)
	â€¢	Create /app/urls/page.jsx (server: session check, fetches userâ€™s URLs, passes to client component)
	â€¢	Create UrlsList.jsx (client: edit/delete/clicks display)

â¸»

14. Admin Dashboard
	â€¢	Add isAdmin/banned to users (set at least one admin in DB)
	â€¢	Create /app/admin/page.jsx (server: check session and isAdmin, fetch all users/urls)
	â€¢	Create AdminPanel.jsx (client: search, ban/unban, delete/edit links)
	â€¢	Create /app/api/admin/user/[id]/route.js (PATCH to ban/unban users)

â¸»

15. Sign Out Button
	â€¢	Create /app/components/SignOutButton.jsx (client: calls signOut)
	â€¢	Render it only if user is logged in (session check in layout/header)

	â€¢	NEXTAUTH_URL
	â€¢	BLOCKED_SIGNUP_DOMAIN

â¸»

17. Deploy
	â€¢	Push to GitHub
	â€¢	Deploy on Vercel

Bonus:
	â€¢	Test all flows: sign up, login, shorten URL, click counts, dashboard actions, admin panel
	â€¢	Check error handling and security (blocked domains, admin checks)
